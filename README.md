# hpyer

hpyer is an asynchronous HTTP client library for Python. It is written in Rust and wraps the excellent [hyper](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper) client internally. The goal is to keep the interface of [aiohttp](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp) while being a safe, fast and correct alternative.

# TODO

* Model the HTTP client API
* Cookie Jar
